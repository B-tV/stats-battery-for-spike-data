# stats-battery-for-spike-data
this was what i used to collect a ton of statistics into one place for neural spike data.
I haven't checked it since ~2016 for compatibility with matlab (so MATLAB 2015B should work fine, but no promises beyond that)
It should represent pretty well what I taught myself through my grad program.

If you seek missing dependencies, lmk, and i'll check my vast collection (maybe i'll list the entire thing one of these days...)
Reach out if you're interested! benthevoice at tutanota
